      <h3><b>The Long body and the Haudenosanee</b></h3>
      <h5>These are native tribes that plan ahead for seven generations. 
      Haudenosanee means literally 'those who build' but also refers to
        the concept of the Long Body: an extension of the individual to 
        include larger family, partners, allies and belongings, all 
        that shapes and nourishes their community. 
      These alliances were sometimes forged in violent battles against common enemies, 
        like in the Iroquois Wars. But in times of truce, I like to think that 
        the extended community builds for the common good and shares know-how, commodities and affection. 
        I like to cook and feed people and share a few recipes with the 
        remote parts my own long body who cannot taste them day to day.
