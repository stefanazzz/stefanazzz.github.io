Clinopyroxene (Ca, Na)(Mg, Fe2+, Al)Si2O6 Appearing in ECLOGITE from deep (60-500 km) subduction metamorphism. 
Gradually transofrms in GARNET bewtween 200 and 500 km.
Typically pale green and accompanied by garnet, forming a green+red "Christmas" rock in ECLOGITE.},
  comment  = {Plagioclase is stable at crustal pressures, and forms Cpx and Opx at higher pressures

Pl + Ol   → Cpx + Opx + Sp

CaAl2Si2O8 (plg) + Mg2SiO4 (ol) → 2MgSiO3 (opx) + CaMgSi2O6 (cpx) + MgAl2O4 (sp)

At approximately 90 km depth, spinel decompose and pyrope garnet becomes the stable aluminous phase.

MgAl2O4 (sp) + 1.55 Mg2Si2O6 (opx) + 0.45 CaMgSi2O6 (cpx) = 0.85 Mg3Al2Si3O12 (garnet) + 0.15 Ca3Al2Si3O12 (garnet) + Mg2SiO4 (ol).

Garnet lherzolite is a major constituent of the Earth's upper mantle (extending to 300 km depth).},

@Manual{amphibole,
  title    = {amphibole},
  abstract = {Amphiboles are minerals of either igneous or metamorphic origin. 
More common in intermediate to felsic igneous rocks than in mafic igneous rocks, because the higher silica and dissolved water content of the more evolved magmas favors formation of amphiboles rather than pyroxenes.  
In chemical composition and general characteristics they are similar to the pyroxenes, the chief differencesis they contain essential hydroxyl (OH) or halogen (F, Cl).

@Manual{Serpentine,
  title    = {Serpentine},
  abstract = {Serpentinite is formed by near to complete serpentinization of mafic to ultramafic rocks. 
Serpentinite can be formed wherever ultramafic rock is infiltrated by water poor in carbon dioxide. 
This occurs at mid-ocean ridges and in the forearc mantle of subduction zones.

The final mineral composition of serpentinite is usually dominated by lizardite, chrysotile (two minerals of the serpentine subgroup), and magnetite (Fe3O4). 

Brucite (Mg(OH)2) and antigorite are less commonly present. Lizardite, chrysotile, and antigorite all have approximately the formula 
Mg3(Si2O5)(OH)4 or (Mg2+, Fe2+)3Si2O5(OH)4, 
Accessory minerals, present in small quantities, include awaruite, other native metal minerals, and sulfide minerals.

The serpentinization reaction involving the transformation of fayalite (Fe-end member of olivine) by water into magnetite and quartz also produces molecular hydrogen H2 according to the following reaction:
 Fe2SiO4 + 2 H2O → 2 Fe3O4 + 3 SiO2 + 3 H2
