  title: Password for static web pages with example of github.io
  abstract: Password access to a static web page on a server like github.io. Protected
    contents go in a folder which name is a long alphanumerical code. The folder name
    is generated when inserting the password for the first time. The index.html file
    is next to that folder, containing the password insert protocol. I used this successfully
    for github.io hosted pages (see html links).
