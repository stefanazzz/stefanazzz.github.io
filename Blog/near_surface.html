      <h3><b>Geophysics of the environment</b></h3>
      <h6>Over the past few years I have added near-surface geophysics to my research. 
      I use geophysical tools in unconventional ways to explore archaeology, geoarchaeology, 
      uderground water flow, water inflitration in historical monuments 
      and other environmental issues.<br>
      Living, working and leading student field trips 
      in the North East and in the Lakes district, with their rich historical, 
      prehistorical and natural backgroung, opened for me a myriad of 
      opportunities to explore what is under our feet in everyday's 
      life. What with Hardrian's wall, the ultimate frontier of the Roman empire. 
      Aand those who dwelled on these hills before (bronze age) and after (medieval)? 
      Arriving here straight from Rome where I lived for more than ten years
      it feels like I am not so far from home after all with all these ancient stones. 
      But here the artifacts are mostly underground. We need to dig, or... use geophysics!
      <br>
      Also, you' be right to ask, with all this rain where does the water go??
      Not so easy, mate! Yes there are rivers, and streams, and man-made drains 
      but there are also mysterious underground channels and flows through the dirt 
      and water sinking in and pouring out of the ground further astray...  And
      loads of abandoned coal mines that are flooded with water, too. 
      <br> Now how about that mine water, is it warm? Sure enough it's warmer than
     the chilling air at these latitudes in the winter, so part of that relative heat can
     be extracted with heat pumps and used to warm up houses or greenhouses or malls... 
     Wait a miniute, now we're talking about geothermal energy! And we're not even close to Iceland.
     Is this a thing? It is and you can find more on this at  <a href="https://gems.ac.uk/"> THE GEMS PROJECT</a>   
      <br>
     The rain (yes, again!) also falls on buildings, roads and bridges. Some of them are historic stone-made
     monuments. The water always finds its way, even through masonery structures, if they are ageing and not well conserved.
     If we can make a topmographic image of underground water paths with geophysics, why can't we image the
     water paths through buildings? It turns out that I tried this out with the help of students and colleagues
     and you can see some results at  <a href="#prebends">PREBENDS BRIDGE</a>.
     <br>
     And as far as being up to our elbows in the mud with all the recent rain, 
     we might as well go all the way. That's why we decided with a group of students 
     to inspect a <a href="#dam"> breached dam </a> as part of their field trip. 

       <div style="width:1000; border-width:3px; border-style:solid; border-color: #abb2b9; padding: 1em;">
          <span class="w3-tag">Keep posted</span>
          for more geophysics soon to come with ventures in archaelogy, flooded grazing fields and the 
          search for a lost dam buried in the sandy loams of an estuary...

      <p>Electrical Resitivity Tomography (ERT) works on soil, bedrock, and even on   
      <a href="https://doi.org/10.3997/1873-0604.2005043"> tree trunks </a> and 
      <a href="https://www.pygimli.org/_examples_auto/3_ert/plot_06_ert_tree.html"> standing trees</a>.
      Then why not on man-made stone structures like historical bridges? I was up to the challenge
      but short of time, until I found a student how was willing to spend hours on the bridge in the cold rain 
      for their 3rd year project...
      Then again another student who applied for my project under the <a href="https://www.ukri.org/what-we-do/developing-people-and-skills/nerc/nerc-studentships/funding-for-nerc-studentships/undergraduate-research-experience-placements-reps/">
      NERC  Research Experience Placement Program</a>.  
      The challenge was that we could not drill the bridge to plant electrodes inside, but had to find
      a non-destructive way. <br>
      We used both medical sticky pads and some specially-made aluminum plate 
      electrodes the I designed and that work quite well by applying a conductive gel between the surface 
      and the electrode plate. 
      <br> Imaging was obtained by modelling electric current on a numercial mesh 
      with the shape of the bridge and performing an inverse problem with the help of the 
      <a href="https://www.pygimli.org"> pygimli</a> open source software library.
      The results are in press on <i> <b> Journal of Architectural Conservation </b> </i> and a preprint 
      of the manuscript will be soon available <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/13556207.2024.2357501"> <b> here</b></a>
      with details of the method used.
