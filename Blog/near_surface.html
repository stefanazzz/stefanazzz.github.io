      <h3><b>Geophysics of the environment</b></h3>
      <h6>Over the past few years I have added near-surface geophysics to my research. 
      I use geophysical tools in unconventional ways to explore archaeology, geoarchaeology, 
      uderground water flow, water inflitration in historical monuments 
      and other environmental issues.<br>
      Living, working and leading student field trips 
      in the North East and in the Lakes district, with their rich historical, 
      prehistorical and natural backgroung, opened for me a myriad of 
      opportunities to explore what is under our feet in everyday's 
      life. What with Hardrian's wall, the ultimate frontier of the Roman empire. 
      Aand those who dwelled on these hills before (bronze age) and after (medieval)? 
      Arriving here straight from Rome where I lived for more than ten years
      it feels like I am not so far from home after all with all these ancient stones. 
      But here the artifacts are mostly underground. We need to dig, or... use geophysics!
      <br>
      Also, you' be right to ask, with all this rain where does the water go??
      Not so easy, mate! Yes there are rivers, and streams, and man-made drains 
      but there are also mysterious underground channels and flows through the dirt 
      and water sinking in and pouring out of the ground further astray...  And
      loads of abandoned coal mines that are flooded with water, too. 
      <br> Now how about that mine water, is it warm? Sure enough it's warmer than
the chilling air at these latitudes in the winter, so part of that relative heat can
be extracted with heat pumps and used to warm up houses or greenhouses or malls... 
Wait a miniute, now we're talking about geothermal energy! And we're not even close to Iceland.
Is this a thing? It is and you can find more on this at  <a href="https://gems.ac.uk/"> THE GEMS PROJECT</a>   
      <br>
The rain (yes, again!) also falls on buildings, roads and bridges. Some of them are historic stone-made
monuments. The water always finds its way, even through masonery structures, if they are ageing and not well conserved.
If we can make a topmographic image of underground water paths with geophysics, why can't we image the
water paths through buildings? It turns out that I tried this out with the help of students and colleagues
and you can see some results at  <a href="">PREBENDS BRIDGE</a>
